# Test with a valid matrix and div
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

# Test with a matrix that is not a list of lists
>>> matrix = "not a matrix"
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Test with a matrix that has rows of different sizes
>>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test with a div that is not a number
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, "not a number")
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
div must be a number

# Test with div equal to 0
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
... except Exception as e:
...     print(e)
division by zero
